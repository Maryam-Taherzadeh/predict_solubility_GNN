# Solubility Prediction App

This app predicts water solubility (logS) of small molecules using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained on the AqSolDB dataset.

## Features
- ðŸ”¬ Predict logS from molecule name or SMILES
- ðŸ§  GNN model with atom-level and molecular descriptors
- ðŸ“„ PDF report generator
- ðŸ“ˆ Visualization of predictions vs training distribution

Built with **Streamlit**, **PyTorch Geometric**, and **RDKit**.
